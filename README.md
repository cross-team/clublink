Supporting Clubhouse rooms with quick link sharing.


Clubl.ink was created out of a necessity for Clubhouse app users to share links while chatting in rooms.
As moderators need a quick way to direct their audience to a web site in a simple and friedly way to describe a link verbally.

__clubl.ink does just that__.
